# APT Scanner

Open source tool to perform API security scan in ```APT```. This scanner uses ```nmap``` in order
to get some details about our target. In this app, we get system information, critical issues, system vulnerabilities,
and system dependencies. After that we return a list of possible vulnerabilities that might be used in a penetrating testing
for that target.
